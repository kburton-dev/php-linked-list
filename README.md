# php-linked-list
A linked list implementation in PHP. This linked list will maintain an ordered list of nodes from smallest to greatest. Inserting a new node will place it in the correct position, so the list should never need to be reordered.

Additionally, the linked list can also be reversed using `$list->reverse();`.

## To run
```
php index.php
```

## Output
```
1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1
```
